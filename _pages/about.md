Dr. Sichao Qu is a URC Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of The University of Hong Kong.

Sichao's main research interest is in <mycss>metamaterials</mycss> and general <mycss>wave physics</mycss>.

His doctoral research focused on the study of wave-absorbing metamaterials in a variety of systems, including those involving electromagnetic waves, underwater acoustics, and airborne sound. His contributions have played a pivotal role in advancing the understanding of wave absorption phenomena, and they stand to significantly influence practical applications in the field. The significance of his work is underpinned by his pursuit of optimizing the performance of absorption devices, pushing them towards the very boundaries of physical constraints.

Currently, his research activities extend to the fundamental theory of modeling metamaterials and the applications of customizable metamaterials, with the focus on identifying structure-response relation and identifying underlying physical constraints. Meanwhile, he is keeping a close eye on the rapid recent developments in artificial intelligence which may bring new possibilities for the design of metamaterials. In the future, his research may expand to include Broadband Noise Control, Homogenization Theory of Metamaterials, Architectural Acoustics, Non-Hermitian Physics, Disordered and Inhomogeneous Media, and Ultrasonic Imaging.

As for research taste, he is particularly fascinated by topics with following features
1. Renewing physical understanding,
2. Advancing analytical/numerical methods,
3. Holding strong application potential.

He also serves as the reviewer of academic journals such as <em>[Physical Review B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/)</em>, <em>[Physical Reviw Applied](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/)</em>, <em>[National Science Review](https://academic.oup.com/nsr)</em>, <em>[Applied Acoustics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-acoustics)</em>, etc.
