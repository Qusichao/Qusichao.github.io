Dr. Sichao Qu is a URC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Hong Kong.

Sichao's main research interest is in <mycss>metamaterials</mycss> and general <mycss>wave physics</mycss>.

His PhD research covered wave-absorbing metamaterials in electromagnetic, underwater and airborne acoustic systems. His works have been instrumental in advancing the fields of wave absorption and are poised to have a widespread impact on the practical applications. The importance of the contributions lies in his pursuit of optimizing the performance of absorbing devices toward the boundaries of physical limitations.

Currently, his research activities extend to the fundamental theory of modeling metamaterials and the applications of customizable metamaterials, with the focus on identifying structure-response relation for metamaterials, as well as discovering underlying physical constraints. Meanwhile, he is keeping a close eye on the rapid recent developments in artificial intelligence which may bring new possibilities for the design of metamaterials. In the future, his research may expand to include Broadband Noise Control, Homogenization Theory of Metamaterials, Architectural Acoustics, Non-Hermitian Physics, Disordered and Inhomogeneous Media, and Ultrasonic Imaging.

As for research taste, he is particularly fascinated by topics with following characteristics:
1. Renewing physical understanding,
2. Advancing analytical/numerical methods,
3. Holding strong application potential.

He also serves as the reviewer of academic journals such as <em>[Physical Review B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/)</em>, <em>[Physical Reviw Applied](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/)</em>, <em>[National Science Review](https://academic.oup.com/nsr)</em>, <em>[Applied Acoustics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-acoustics)</em>, etc.
