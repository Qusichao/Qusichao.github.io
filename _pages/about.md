Sichao Qu is a URC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Hong Kong.

Sichao's main research interest is in <mycss>metamaterials</mycss> and general <mycss>wave physics</mycss>.

Before that, his research field was mainly absorbing metamaterials, and he systematically explored electromagnetic wave, underwater sound, airborne sound and pushed the performance of related absorption device to the limit. Currently, his research activities extend to the fundamental theory of metamaterials and the applications of customizable acoustic metamaterials. He is particularly interested in the relationship between the structure of metamaterials and their broadband wave reponse, as well as discovering underlying physical constraints. Meanwhile, the rapid recent developments in artificial intelligence are also bringing new possibilities for the design of metamaterials. So, he is keeping a close eye on and exploring 'AI for Metamaterials'.

He is mainly fascinated by topics that have the following characteristics:
1. Renewing physical understanding,
2. Advancing analytical/numerical methods,
3. Holding strong application potential.

He serves as the reviewer of academic journals such as <em>[Physical Review B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/)</em>, <em>[Physical Reviw Applied](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/)</em>, <em>[National Science Review](https://academic.oup.com/nsr)</em>, <em>[Applied Acoustics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-acoustics)</em>, etc.
