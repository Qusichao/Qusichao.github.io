  abstract={By introducing metallic ring structural dipole resonances in the microwave regime, we have designed and realized a metamaterial absorber with hierarchical structures that can display an averaged −19.4 dB reflection loss (∼99%
  absorption) from 3 to 40 GHz. The measured performance is independent of the polarizations of the incident wave at normal incidence, 
  while absorption at oblique incidence remains considerably effective up to 45°. We provide a conceptual basis for
  our absorber design based on the capacitive-coupled electrical dipole resonances in the lateral plane, coupled to the standing wave along the incident wave direction.
  To realize broadband impedance matching, resistive dissipation of the metallic ring is optimally tuned by using the approach of dispersion engineering. 
  To further extend the absorption spectrum to an ultrabroadband range, we employ a double-layer self-similar structure in conjunction with the absorption of the diffracted waves at the higher end of the frequency spectrum. 
  The overall thickness of the final sample is 14.2 mm, only 5
  % 
  over the theoretical minimum thickness dictated by the causality limit.},

 abstract={Topological insulators have attracted intensive attention due to their robust properties of path defect immunity, with diverse applications in
electromagnetic, acoustic, and elastic systems. The recent development of elastic topological insulators (ETIs), based on artificially structured
phononic crystals, has injected new momentum into the manipulation of elastic waves. Earlier ETIs with unreconfigurable geometry
and narrow frequency bandgaps hinder the exploration and design of adaptable devices. In this work, a tunable phononic crystal plate with
Y-shaped prisms is designed to support valley transport of elastic waves, based on the analogy of the quantum valley Hall effect. By rotating
the prisms to reconstruct the configuration, the mirror symmetry is broken to open a new bandgap. Based on this characteristic, we design
an interface between two ETIs with different symmetry-broken geometries, which supports topologically protected edge states. We further
design a reconfigurable device for elastic wave channel switching and beam splitting and demonstrate it both numerically and experimentally.
In addition, in order to meet the requirement of the wide frequency range, the genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the geometry so as
to achieve the broadband valley transportation of elastic waves. The results obtained in this paper can promote the practical applications of
tunable broadband elastic wave transmission},

  abstract={By using a structured tungsten-polyurethane composite that is impedance matched to water while simultaneously having a much slower 
  longitudinal sound speed, we have theoretically designed and experimentally realized an underwater acoustic 
  absorber exhibiting high absorption from 4 to 20 kHz, measured in a 5.6 m by 3.6 m water pool with the 
  time-domain approach. The broadband functionality is achieved by optimally engineering the distribution 
  of the Fabry-Perot resonances, based on an integration scheme, to attain impedance matching over a broad 
  frequency range. The average thickness of the integrated absorber, 8.9 mm, is in the deep subwavelength 
  regime (~/42 at 4 kHz) and close to the causal minimum thickness of 8.2 mm that is evaluated from the 
  simulated absorption  spectrum.  The  structured  composite  represents  a  new  type  of  acoustic  
  metamaterials  that  has  high  acoustic energy density and promises broad underwater applications.},

  abstract={Wave absorption metamaterials have been an enduring topic over the past two decades, propelled 
not only by novel scientific advances, but also by their extensive application potential. In this review, 
we aim to provide some general insights into the absorption mechanism common to both microwave 
and acoustic systems. By establishing a universal model for resonance-based metamaterials, we 
present the theoretical conditions for broadband impedance matching and introduce the fundamental 
causal limit as an evaluation tool for absorption performance. Under this integrated framework, we 
survey the recent advances on metamaterials absorption in both microwave and acoustic systems, 
with the focus on those that pushed the overall performance close to the causal limit. We take note 
of some new, emerging metastructures that can circumvent the constraint imposed by causal limit, 
thereby opening a new avenue to low-frequency absorption. This review concludes by discussing 
the existing challenges with possible solutions and the broad horizon for future developments.},

  abstract={Helmholtz resonator (HR) has always been an important part of artificial sound-absorbing materials, most of
which however cannot be tuned in real time and hence have a limited scope of applications. In this work, we
integrate for the first time the soft hyperelastic material into the main structure of HR to design a star-shaped soft
Helmholtz absorber. The soft HR exhibits different post-buckling deformation behavior when its wall-thickness
varies, which further yields different acoustic characteristics. By combining two star-shaped HRs with different
wall-thickness, we are able to achieve asymmetric sound absorption when specific and respective compression
loads are applied to the two HRs. In addition, high sound absorption at various frequencies can be obtained via
different combinations of the applied loads. Due to the perfect capability of reversible large deformation of soft
hyperelastic materials, the sound absorption of the proposed pair of HRs can be real-time tuned effectively by
mechanical loading and unloading. In other words, the acoustic switch controlled by mechanical load can be
realized. The proposed soft absorber has an obvious practical application value, and also provides an important
illustration for the design of soft and tunable acoustic devices.},

  abstract={The advent of broadband and tunable acoustic metamaterials, amenable to be fabricated into flat panel
geometry, offers broad, emerging possibilities for room acoustics. In particular, the fine tuning of surface
acoustic impedance becomes possible to optimize specific room acoustic goals. In this initial simulation
study we examine the possibility of minimizing the averaged level of energy density (Le), both globally and locally in an enclosed room. The relationship curve between surface impedance and global Le
shows an optimal value that can reduce Le by about 15–20 dB over a wide audible frequency regime.
Moreover, partial coverage of the room surface by the optimally tuned acoustic metamaterial already
demonstrates considerable effectiveness. We compare and verify our numerical model with the statisticaldiffusive acoustics model and find good agreement in the high-frequency regime. In the low-frequency
regime, the energy inhomogeneity caused by wave interference can be utilized to create a quiet zone for
specific targeted frequency by optimally tuning the surface impedance values at discretized locations on
the four walls.},

  abstract={In recent years, metamaterials have gained considerable attention as a promising material technology due to
their unique properties and customizable design, distinguishing them from traditional materials. This article delves into
the value of acoustic metamaterials in room acoustics, particularly in small room acoustics that poses specific challenges
due to their significant cavity resonant nature. Small rooms usually exhibit an inhomogeneous frequency response spectrum,
requiring higher wall absorption with specific spectrum to achieve a uniform acoustic environment, i.e., a constant reverberation
time over a wide audible frequency band. To tackle this issue, we developed a design that simultaneously incorporates numerous
subwavelength acoustic resonators at different frequencies to achieve customized broadband absorption for the walls of a specific
example room. The on-site experimental measurements agree well with the numerical predictions, attesting to the robustness of the
design and method. The proposed method of reverse-engineering metamaterials by targeting specific acoustic requirements has broad
applicability and unique advantages in small confined spaces with high acoustic requirements, such as recording studios,
listening rooms, and car cabins.},
